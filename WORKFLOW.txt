Game Starts:
  1- Godot loads Main Scene "res://Scripts/Core/starter.tscn"
  2- Autoloads "Game, LevelLoader, Console"
  3- Game "_Ready" loads then spawns the player in the root "Check SpawnPlayer()"
  4- Game "_Ready" loads then spawns Console
  5- Game calls level loader and loads the first level "Check LoadFirstLevel()" and reparents the player to that first level
  6- Done :D "Hopefully no errors"

Notes :
  1- Any level MUSN'T include any player scene inside of it, the LevelLoader handels that
  2- Before making any level changing make sure to NOT CHANGE THE LEVEL MORE THAN ONE TIME, use a flag or something idk
